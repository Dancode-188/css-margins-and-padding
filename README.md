# My Portfolio page

This is a creative and visually appealing portfolio website built with HTML and CSS. The website showcases my name, a brief introduction, a list of skills, and contact information. The design focuses on implementing specific features using CSS, with a particular emphasis on margins and padding.

## Features

- **Header Styling:** The header section displays my name with a dark background color and padding for a stylish look.
- **Introduction Section:** This section includes a brief introduction about myself, with a light gray background, padding, and margins for spacing. The text is centered.
- **Skills Display:** The skills section lists my skills as bordered list items with padding. The list items are centered and wrapped to multiple lines if necessary. Margins are used for spacing between skills.
- **Contact Information:** The contact section provides my email address and links to my social media profiles. It has a light gray background color, padding, and margins for clarity. The links have a hover effect with an underline.
- **Responsive Design:** The website is responsive, thanks to the use of media queries. The layout adjusts for smaller screen sizes (up to 768px) by reducing padding and margins, and by left-aligning the skills list.
